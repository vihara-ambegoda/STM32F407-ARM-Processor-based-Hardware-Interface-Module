## ðŸ“Œ Features
- **Microcontroller:** STM32F407 (LQFP100 package)
- **PCB Type:** 4-layer board
- **Design Software:** Altium Designer 16
- **Approach:** Hierarchical *Flat Design* using multi-sheet schematics
- **Interfaces Included:**
  - JTAG (Joint Test Action Group)
  - USB (Universal Serial Bus)
- **Custom Libraries:** Created schematic symbols & footprints for unavailable components

## ðŸ›  Design Process
1. **Research & Preparation**
   - Studied multilayer PCB concepts, THM vs SMT, EMC, and PCB testing methods
   - Reviewed STM32F407 datasheet, identified pin configurations & peripheral requirements

2. **Schematic Design**
   - Created separate schematic sheets for power, communication, and microcontroller configurations
   - Added JTAG, USB, voltage regulator, and crystal oscillator circuits
   - Used custom libraries for missing components

3. **PCB Layout**
   - Defined board shape and set 4-layer stackup
   - Placed components on both sides of PCB
   - Adjusted routing widths for connectors

4. **Manufacturing Output**
   - Generated assembly drawings, drill files, and 3D views
